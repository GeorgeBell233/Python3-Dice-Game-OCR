-----How to use------

1) First run "Python Dice Project Login Manager" to create at least two logins, these will be saved to a file so this will only have to be done once.
	
Note: If you forget a password you can either create a new login, or input the username of the account's password you want to change in the "Python Dice Project Login Manager"
 
2) Afterwards use those login details in Python Dice Project to login and the rest will run as it should. 
    If not enough logins are incorportated, the program will notify you and you will need to create them in the Python Dice Project Login Manager
    
Other notes:
	All CSV files can be safely deleted and the programs can handle it
	
	All files must be in same directory
